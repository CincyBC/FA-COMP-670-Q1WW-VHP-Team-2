  Augment your skills with a minor
</h1>
									<div>
									<div>
						
  <p>Customize your degree by taking additional courses of interest, known as a minor, as part of your academic program.</p><p>What is a minor and, more importantly, what can it do for you?</p><p>Minors are additional courses outside of your major field of study. They usually enhance your major in some way, such as allowing you to develop special expertise within your field; or they allow you to add a new skillset to complement the ones you’re already acquiring within your major.</p><p>For example, an accounting major may want to minor in business economics to secure a more segmented economics job in the field. Or, an information systems major may want to minor in communication in order to become a better presenter. The additional qualifications as a result of taking minor courses may lead to new opportunities and future advancement.</p><p>And because you choose your minor based on your interests, your degree becomes completely unique to you. There’s no limit to how many minors you can have, though, with careful planning, you may be able to complete your minor as part of your required degree program hours.</p>

                        <div class="expandable_content"><p>Most assets escape exploitation not because they are impregnable but because they are not targeted.   (Herley, 2014    p.70)   Cybercrime is perpetrated all over the world and results in tremendous financial loss to many individuals, businesses, and countries of the World. This course sets out to accomplish several learning outcomes but also to develop a level of literacy about cyber related crime that will help to diminish or mitigate the problems associated with these types of crimes. The awareness of cybercrime-related activity as it pertains to your everyday life is important to your ability to navigate away from this serious criminal activity that is just beginning to grip our society. This course is designed as a literacy course and although it has critical terminology is not fundamentally a computer forensics or technical course.  Herley, C., (2014).
