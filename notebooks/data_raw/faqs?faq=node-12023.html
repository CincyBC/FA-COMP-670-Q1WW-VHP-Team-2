		Do I need to have an MSN before starting a DNP program?
		<a></a>
	</div>
	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>Good news! The answer is “no.” You can be admitted to the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree program through Franklin’s BSN to DNP pathway. With this pathway, you will take two bridge courses (NURS 800 and NURS 805) first. Once you successfully complete these courses, you will be fully admitted to the DNP program. By the way, this is the same pathway that anyone with a BSN and a non-nursing master’s degree would follow for the DNP degree.</p>

	<div class="expandable_header">

  <p>No. However, as a prerequisite to full admission to the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program, you will complete two bridge courses that cover foundational knowledge from the M.S. in Nursing (MSN) program. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	</div>
	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>Practicum hours focus on skill development in essential areas, including leadership, informatics, finance and patient safety. Some of your practicum hours will be completed at a practicum site with a preceptor to guide your work. Other hours are considered experiential and will be facilitated by a faculty member as part of your coursework. In addition, as part of your practicum, you will develop a scholarly project using an evidence-based intervention and quality improvement framework that addresses a gap in practice, process, or policy at your practice site. Bottom line? You’ll be able to complete about half of your practicum hours during your coursework!</p>

An FSA ID is a registered username and password for signing into certain Federal Student Aid websites, including Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®), StudentLoans.gov and My Federal Student Aid. Your FSA ID is used to electronically sign Federal Student Aid documents, access your personal records and make legally binding obligations. Please keep your information secure. Parents who are required to sign a child's FAFSA need their own FSA ID, however, the parent's ID can be used to sign more than one child's application.</p>

The difference between Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Federal Loans is that the federal government pays the interest on a Subsidized loan -- as long you are enrolled in school at least half-time.

• The minimum loan amount you may accept is $200.<br>
• All subsidized funds must be accepted before accepting/reducing unsubsidized loans.<br>
•&nbsp;To reduce funds, you must indicate the revised amount on your offer&nbsp;letter or notate a full decline of the loan. Please follow the instructions on your Offer&nbsp;Letter.

Verification is the process in which the Financial Aid office compares the information provided on your FAFSA with the information reported on your, your spouse's or your parent's federal taxes, W-2s and/or our verification forms. You may be selected for verification by the government or through our internal selection process. If selected for verification, you will not be considered eligible for federal or state financial aid until all documentation is received and reviewed.</p>

Perhaps. You may be considered for appeal if:<br>
<br>
•&nbsp;You have mitigating circumstances and supporting documentation that you are no longer in contact with or receive financial support from your parents.<br>
• You are still in contact with your parents, but they are unwilling to provide financial information for FAFSA. Please contact the Student Financial Services Office to schedule an appointment to a Parental Non-Disclosure Appeal.<br>

Schedule an appointment with a Student Financial Services Counselor to discuss appealing the decision.</p>

		What is Franklin University Alerts?
		<a></a>
	</div>
	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>Franklin University Alerts is a text messaging and email notification system that will notify registered users when there is a major emergency, crisis situation or disaster, or a weather emergency closing or delay for the Franklin University locations.</p>

	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>Franklin University faculty, staff and students automatically have their Franklin University email addresses enrolled in the Franklin University Alerts system. The Franklin University Alerts system will send an email to registered accounts notifying the users that the email is registered in the system and provides the user the opportunity to “opt-out” of the system and not receive future notifications.</p>

  <p>"Once registered, users may log in to their Franklin University Alerts account to input additional email addresses and mobile phone numbers.<br>
Users may login to their account <a href="/about-us/university-details/safety-security">here</a>.<br>
The account login username is the first part of the user’s email address, located before the @ symbol (e.g. <a href="mailto:user01@franklin.edu">user01@franklin.edu</a>). To obtain the account password, select the link: “Forgot Password?” At the next screen enter the user’s login Username (example: user01) into the login box and click on the “Send Password” button. The Franklin University Alerts system will send a temporary password to the user email account registered in the system.<br>

	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>Once Franklin sends an alert through Franklin University Alerts, the message is sent to a large number of telephone and email service providers. These providers control how quickly messages are delivered to phones and email mailboxes. Delayed message delivery is almost always due to the telephone/email provider and how the message has been processed through their network. Emergency information and weather delays or cancellations are also posted on the Franklin University website.</p>

	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>Certain cellular providers limit the length of a text message. Some carriers deliver over-length text messages as two or more. Some simply discard the portion of the message that is too long. In the event that you receive a Franklin University Alerts and it is 'cut off,' you can view the entire message by logging in to your account. Every effort will be made by Franklin to make the messages as brief as possible to avoid this problem.</p>

  <p>Turnitin&nbsp;is an originality verification tool&nbsp;that instructors and students can utilize to check for originality within a document. Since plagiarism is not always intentional, this tool helps students protect themselves from possible plagiarism scenarios but also helps instructors intentional or unintentional&nbsp;attempts to plagiarize.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Canvas has built in integration with the Turnitin plagiarism check tool. Many assignments have Turnitin integration enabled. When enabled, submitting the assignment through Canvas also applies the Turnitin plagiarism check to that assignment.&nbsp;</p>

Plus, our curriculum adds to your foundational knowledge of programming, networking, security and databases with advanced information systems, networking, systems administration, project management and cloud computing courses. Differentiate yourself even more by choosing two electives from advanced offerings in project management, analytics, security and systems administration.</p>

<p><strong><em>Human subject</em></strong> means a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducts research and (i) Obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens; or (ii) Obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens.

Their education and practice focus on serving those patients. The PMHNP will often serve as the specialized provider for patients over the long term, typically taking a wellness-based and holistic approach to mental healthcare while also providing integrated care for mental illness in primary care settings.</p>

	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>Franklin University faculty will collaborate with you, however, you are expected to be ready with a site and a preceptor upon notification of acceptance. Being prepared helps prevent delays with starting any coursework that involves a clinical rotation. Because you’re probably familiar with potential clinical sites available in your area (including practices that might be owned and managed by your employer), we suggest you begin there. You can also look at smaller MD/NP/DO-owned practices. Then we’ll help you obtain site and preceptor approval, as well as ensure that the necessary paperwork is finalized. Ideally, placement arrangements are identified six months in advance and formally confirmed no later than two weeks before the first clinical course. So, depending on when you start your clinical rotations, this could be during the first term.&nbsp;<br>

  <p>There are several benefits to earning and a claiming a badge:</p>

<ul>
	<li>They allow you to share your abilities online in a way that is simple, trusted and verifiable.</li>
	<li>They provide employers and peers evidence of what you had to do to earn your credential and what you are now capable of. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Each badge has a series of skills associated with it, which are connected to real-time labor market insights – what jobs requiring those skills are available, where jobs are located, salary ranges, related skills, etc.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>They provide “milestones” on the way to graduation. &nbsp;You can immediately receive a verifiable credential to demonstrate to your employer and peers the achievement, skills and capabilities you have acquired through your completed coursework.</li>

  <p>Franklin University faculty will collaborate with you, however, you are expected to be ready with a site and a preceptor upon notification of acceptance. Being prepared helps prevent delays with starting any coursework that involves a clinical rotation. Because you’re probably familiar with potential clinical sites available in your area (including practices that might be owned and managed by your employer), we suggest you begin there. You can also look at smaller MD/NP/DO-owned practices. Then we’ll help you obtain site and preceptor approval, as well as ensure that the necessary paperwork is finalized. Ideally, placement arrangements are identified six months in advance and formally confirmed&nbsp;no later than two weeks before the first clinical course. So, depending on when you start your clinical rotations, this could be during the first term.&nbsp;</p>

		How difficult is it to find a preceptor?
		<a></a>
	</div>
	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>It depends. You’ll likely want to find a placement in your community or within reasonable travel distance. Large urban cities and areas with multiple nursing programs can make this difficult. To that end, think broadly and creatively as you plan your search including having to travel or possibly spend the night.</p>

		Are there any tips to finding a good match for a preceptor and/or site?
		<a></a>
	</div>
	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>Consider using social media to aid in your search. Join local nurse practitioner groups and state nursing associations on Facebook and LinkedIn and utilize direct messaging on both platforms. For PMHNPs, consider joining the local therapists’ groups in addition to NP groups. Not only will these be places to seek placements for your first clinical course, they will ultimately be great sources of referrals when you graduate.</p>

<p>You may also try visiting a potential site/preceptor. Approach this initial visit as an “interview” and an excellent opportunity to “sell” your abilities/interest for becoming a leader in the organization or nurse practitioner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don’t forget to take advantage of professional relationships in the workplace, community groups, church, etc. to connect you to someone who may be able to serve as a preceptor or personally introduce you to someone who may be available.</p>

  <p>Clinics, health departments, mobile clinics or private offices that offer primary care family practice or internal medicine are acceptable sites.

  <div  id="node-80043" class="expandable">
	<div class="expandable_header">
		Why should I become a Franklin University preceptor?
		<a></a>
	</div>
	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>There are almost too many reasons to count! First, becoming a preceptor for the NP programs at Franklin University is a great opportunity for experienced advanced practice nurses to give back to the profession by literally paying it forward to the next generation of nurses. And because preceptors are role models and mentors to aspiring nurse practitioners (NPs), as a preceptor, you can make a real difference in someone’s nursing career just by being an inspiration and influence.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Second, by training new APRNs, you’ll play a crucial role in increasing access to care and improving healthcare outcomes for patients. Finally, precepting helps you keep up with the new skills and changes that occur in nursing. So, you’ll not only help someone else learn, you’ll be learning yourself from students who are continually exposed to the latest knowledge and techniques in the nursing profession.</p>


	</div>
	
</div>
  <div  id="node-80044" class="expandable">
	<div class="expandable_header">
		What does it take to become a preceptor for the NP programs?
		<a></a>
	</div>
	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>Because preceptors work closely with Franklin’s clinical supervising faculty to ensure that NP students achieve clinical course outcomes, the following are required of our preceptors:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Licensure and Experience: Preceptors must hold a current, unencumbered state license as an APRN, physician, physician associate (PA), licensed clinical social worker, psychologist, or licensed professional counselor, and have at least one (1) year of experience in an area of practice relevant to the student’s clinical needs. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Advanced Degree: Nurse preceptors must hold a master’s or doctoral degree.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>National Certification (as appropriate): NPs who act as preceptors require national certification, however DOs and MDs do not.</li>
	<li>CV/Résumé: Franklin University faculty approve all preceptors, so a curriculum vitae/résumé and a copy of the license (and certification as appropriate) are required.</li>
</ol>


	</div>
	
</div>
  <div  id="node-80045" class="expandable">
	<div class="expandable_header">
		What’s the time commitment for nurse preceptors?
		<a></a>
	</div>
	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>Franklin’s preceptors for the nurse practitioner program are expected to invest a reasonable amount of time in guiding and mentoring NP students. Most clinical courses consist of&nbsp; 75-150 hours over a 12- or 16-week trimester. Students are expected to consistently attend clinical throughout the term, which includes a minimum of 8 hours on-site each week.</p>


	</div>
	
</div>
  <div  id="node-80720" class="expandable">
	<div class="expandable_header">
		Do preceptors have a contact person at Franklin University’s School of Nursing?
		<a></a>
	</div>
	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>Yes. Preceptors for the nurse practitioner program may contact the clinical supervising faculty member assigned to the student’s clinical experience. Preceptors also receive an introductory email from the clinical supervising faculty at the beginning of the trimester. Plus, there are one or two virtual (i.e., Zoom) site visits each term between the nurse preceptor and the clinical supervising faculty.</p>

		What can preceptors expect from mentoring an NP student?

	</div>
	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>Every nurse practitioner student has competencies on which they’re expected to focus throughout a trimester. To guide preceptors with respect to student expectations during each clinical rotation, Franklin has a progressive algorithm that you should find very helpful.</p>

	<div class="expandable_header">
		As a preceptor, will I be expected to evaluate or grade NP students?
		<a></a>
	</div>
	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>Franklin’s nurse preceptors are asked to complete both a midterm, as well as a final or summative clinical evaluation of their mentees. The midterm evaluation is formative and meant to provide opportunities for growth. Ideally, the final evaluation is given on the last day of clinical rotation. It is intended to summarize the NP student’s overall performance and growth. These evaluations are provided as guidance to the faculty member responsible for grading the student.&nbsp;</p>

Of course. We've found that employers value the flexibility that online learning offers employees -- especially with hectic travel schedules or variable shifts. Employers of our students know that our online learning format offers the same curriculum, upheld by the very same accrediting bodies and regulatory standards as our onsite classes. Bottomline?

Not easier -- just different. In fact, online learning requires really strong time-management skills.

Hardly. Ethics do not take a backseat in any Franklin classroom, including online. Statistics show that cheating is no more prevalent in an online learning environment than in an outside one.

Absolutely. Online or onsite, you'll learn from the leading industry-expert instructors. When you take online classes you won't, of course, see your instructor in person, in real time; however, you will interact with your instructors through online discussions, emails, chat and online lecture sessions.</p>

  <p>Prior learning credit, also called credit for prior learning, is degree credit awarded for professional training, certificates, credentials, certifications and licensures. Franklin has pre-evaluated 600+ work and life experiences for industry-recognized proficiencies, and awards credit that equates to specific Franklin courses.</p>

  <p>If you completed your training or certificate as part of a degree program at a two- or four-year institution, please have your transcripts sent to <a href="mailto:transcripts@franklin.edu">transcripts@franklin.edu</a>.&nbsp;Electronic transcripts sent by the applicant are not considered official.&nbsp;Instead of evaluating the certificate, we will evaluate your transcript, which will allow you to receive credit beyond what we award for a non-college certificate or training.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you completed your training or certificate in any other way, please submit your certificate, certification, credential, license, or professional record to <a href="mailto:plc@franklin.edu">plc@franklin.edu</a> for review and processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<div class="expandable_content">
		
  <p>No. Certificates and training that have been pre-evaluated have standard credit decisions on file. Experiences that have not been previously evaluated and meet established criteria (assessment, outcomes, rigor and non-continuing education) are put through a faculty review process that includes a rubric to guide the final decision.</p>

  <p>You can provide documentation for your experience before, during or after the admission process.</p>

<p>For current students within a term or two of graduation, please note that submitting a training or certificate to fulfill a graduation requirement is not advised or encouraged. In this case, a proficiency test is the better option.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Franklin’s searchable database contains pre-evaluated certificates, certifications, credentials and licenses that are on file with the transfer credit office. In order to stay ahead of the fast-changing nature of industry-aligned credentials, we will continue to review and evaluate prior learning offerings for degree credit.<br>
<br>
If you do not see your experience listed, you can submit it for evaluation to <a href="mailto:plc@franklin.edu">plc@franklin.edu</a>. Please note the specific course for which you are seeking credit. Unsure which course? Please review the <a href="https://selfservice.franklin.edu/Student/courses">Course Catalog</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
To be evaluated for credit, your experience must meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Contain an exam, test, or assessment to evaluate your knowledge and learning.</li>
	<li>Have specific and clear outcomes. To receive credit for a course, the outcomes for your training have to match at least 70% of the outcomes of a course.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Rise to the level of college level learning. A 4-credit hour course at Franklin is at least 6 weeks long and requires completion of very specific assignments. The content of your experience must be rigorous enough to warrant college credit.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Not be continuing education. While credit can be awarded for a credential or license, it is not automatically awarded for the continuing education needed to maintain that credential. Continuing education courses that have been approved for prior learning credit can be found in <a href="https://www.franklin.edu/transferring-credit/types-transfer-credit/certificates-and-training-credit#node-80453">MyCertificates + Training</a>.</li>

  <p>Whether you earn the B.S. in Nursing (BSN) on the way to your M.S. in Nursing (MSN) depends on your unique situation and ultimate career goals. While the MSN is the necessary credential for teaching or leadership positions, you may need the BSN to obtain your initial nursing position while you work toward the next level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, your employer may have reimbursement programs or career development programs that make earning the BSN more advantageous for you. However, if you know that the MSN is a requirement for your dream job, an RN to MSN program will put you on fast-track to get there quickly and at a lower cost.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Doctoral students transfer both previously earned doctoral credit, as well as master’s level credit (above 30 hours) toward their degrees.

  <p>The maximum number of transfer credits that can be accepted varies by program. For the DBA, DHA and Ed.D. (Organizational Leadership and Instructional Design Leadership programs), you can transfer up to 33 credits. However, the average is usually much less.

We accept transfer credit based on an evaluation of your official transcripts, course descriptions, and syllabi (if available). Transcripts must be sent directly to the Graduate Office from all previously attended colleges.

It depends. Transfer credit may be awarded for courses or professional training offered through business and industry, such as courses taken through the American Institute of Banking (AIB) or the Life Office Management Association (LOMA). Such credit is awarded based on the recommendations found in The National Guide to Educational Credit for Training Programs (published by the American Council on Education), or The Directory of the National Program on Noncollegiate Sponsored Instruction. Official transcripts or original certificates of completion must be submitted for evaluation. Nontraditional certificates also may be reviewed for consideration. In addition to official transcripts or original certificates, please provide your academic advisor with a syllabus or workbook for the course, evidence of a test and the amount of time spent in class.</p>

That depends. First, you must meet Franklin University's residency requirements. For a bachelor’s degree, that means at least 30 credit hours in residence; for an associate degree, it means at least 20 credit hours in residence. You also must successfully complete at least 20 credit hours of major area courses in residence at the 300 or 400 level for the bachelor’s degree; and a minimum of 12 credit hours of major area courses at the 200+ level for the associate degree. If you pursue a subsequent bachelor’s degree, you must earn a minimum of 30 credit hours at the 200 level or above, a minimum of which should be 16 credit hours of major area courses at the 300 or 400 level and a minimum of 12 credit hours of major area courses at the 200 level or above for the associate degree. Upper level courses typically are not applied from a two-year college toward the bachelor’s.</p>
