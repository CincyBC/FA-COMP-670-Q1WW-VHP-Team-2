COMP611 - Advanced Data Structures and Programming
Course Title
Advanced Data Structures and Programming
Credit Hours
4
Course Description
This course covers key knowledge and skills for advanced software development using the object-oriented approach. The student learns, manipulates and reflects on nonlinear data structures such as trees and heaps. Recursive algorithms, sorting algorithms, algorithm efficiency, and advanced design patterns are addressed. To support the advanced concepts and principles of software development, the student will design, code, test, debug, and document programs with increased scale and complexity using industry's best practices (such as GitHub) and the Java programming language.
