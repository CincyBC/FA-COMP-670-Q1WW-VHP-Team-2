  FNP or AGPCNP: Which is the Best Fit for You?




Nursing is a challenging, yet rewarding profession that affords you the opportunity to follow your passion in a rapidly evolving and growing industry. If you are deciding between the Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) and Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner (AGPCNP), there are some important similarities between the two programs. Both specializations:

Require 600 clinical hours and completion of Primary Care I (NURS 701/701C) + Primary Care II  (NURS 702/702C)
Are nationally certified through American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) or American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP)
Equip you for positions in ambulatory care centers, medical offices and correctional facilities

However, below you’ll find some information on what differentiates the two options. Compare the options and find the best fit for you.

  MSN - Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Frequently Asked Questions






		What is an MSN - Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner degree? 
		


An MSN-AGPCNP degree is an advanced degree based on nursing theory and rooted in advanced practice concepts and research-based application. It is for registered nurses (RNs) who want to assume more responsibilities and increase their scope of practice, treating patients from adolescence through end-of-life.




		What can you do with an MSN-Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner degree? 
		


The MSN-AGPCNP degree opens you up to a wide variety of career positions caring for patients in their teens all the way up to the elderly. It’s an ideal degree for RNs with a soft spot for older patients – especially those dealing with chronic conditions, in a long-term care facility, or in need of Medicare assessment. This degree prepares you for careers in a wide variety of settings ranging from long-term care facilities to hospitals to home care.




		Why get an MSN-Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner degree?
		


An MSN with an advanced practice specialty in gerontology prepares you to expand your reach and impact in a variety of areas, including chronic disease prevention and management.




		What makes Franklin’s MSN-Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner degree unique? 
		


Franklin streamlines your educational experience with flexible, online coursework and embedded practicum hours that let you practice while you learn – so you can finish faster. Thanks to simulation software, you’ll get a dynamic online learning experience to sharpen your skills before and during your clinical experience.




		How long is an online MSN-Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner program?
		


Franklin’s MSN-AGPCNP program is designed for busy nurses, so depending on transfer credits, you could finish in 7 trimesters (28 months).




		When can I start an MSN-Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner degree?
		


Getting started with your MSN-AGPCNP is easy and convenient at Franklin. We offer three trimesters every year, with start dates within each. Talk to your admissions advisor to find the start date that's right for you.




		How much will my MSN-Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner degree cost?
		


At Franklin, you’ll get a quality education at a competitive cost so you can afford to invest in your future right now. Our helpful staff can talk with you about flexible financing options as well as financial aid programs. See current tuition and rates here.




		Do you help find clinical sites? 
		


Franklin University faculty will collaborate with you, however, you are expected to be ready with a site and a preceptor upon notification of acceptance. Being prepared helps prevent delays with starting any coursework that involves a clinical rotation. Because you’re probably familiar with potential clinical sites available in your area (including practices that might be owned and managed by your employer), we suggest you begin there. You can also look at smaller MD/NP/DO-owned practices. Then we’ll help you obtain site and preceptor approval, as well as ensure that the necessary paperwork is finalized. Ideally, placement arrangements are identified six months in advance and formally confirmed no later than two weeks before the first clinical course. So, depending on when you start your clinical rotations, this could be during the first term.
