Maybe you’re still trying to determine what that means and what your next options are?The pinnacle of educational attainment is the doctoral degree. But what exactly is a doctoral degree, what can you get your doctorate in and what is involved in the process? Consider this your introduction to doctoral degrees.What Is a Doctorate Degree?The doctorate is the most advanced academic degree you can earn, symbolizing that you have mastered a specific academic discipline or field of profession.Doctorate degrees require a significant level of research and articulation. Those who earn the degree must have researched a subject or topic thoroughly, conducted new research and analysis, and provided a new interpretation or solution to the field.Completing a doctorate program qualifies you for top-tier consulting and education career considerations and positions you as a leader in your field, giving you the edge to stay relevant in today’s competitive labor market. In many cases, completing a doctorate means achieving a lifelong personal goal.Demand for Doctoral DegreesThe demand for doctorate degrees depends on specific fields and positions, but trends in degree completions can help paint a picture of the state of doctoral-level education. According to Lightcast Analytics, from 2012 to 2022, the total number of doctoral degree completions grew by 20%, from 170,815 to 205,341. Doctoral categories that saw the greatest growth in demand over the 10-year period included Business, Management, Marketing and Related Programs (+75%), Computer and Information Sciences and Support Services (+64%), Education (+49%), Health Professions and Related Programs (+49%), and Engineering (+38%).At a more granular level, doctoral programs that saw the greatest growth in demand included Occupational Therapy/Therapist (+1,134%), Nursing Practice (+614%), Organizational Leadership (+368%) and Social Work (+154%). Conversely, programs that saw the greatest decrease in demand included Divinity/Ministry (-42%), History (-26%), Law (-22%) and Psychology (-16%). These trends show that increasingly complex and growing industries tend to require employees with higher levels of expertise, resulting in more demand for doctoral degree holders, while stagnant industries that require less skills development tend to need fewer experts and, thus, fewer employees may feel the need to pursue doctorates. Earning a doctorate is challenging and rewarding, but do you know what to really expect? Download this free guide for tips and insights to help you prepare for success. The Rise of Online Doctorate DegreesTraditionally, higher education institutions only offered doctorates in person, but lately, there has been a shift toward flexible online education. According to Lightcast Analytics, distance-offered doctoral degrees saw a 237% increase in graduates from 2012 to 2022, while non-distance offered programs only grew by 6%.The increase in online doctoral degrees is evident in the fields examined earlier. Distance offered completions increased by 150% for Law, 986% for Nursing Practice, 427% for Educational Leadership and Administration (General), and 243% for Business Administration and Management (General). So, what types of doctorates are available?Two Types of Doctorate DegreesThere are two primary types of doctoral degrees: research-oriented degrees and professional application degrees (also called applied doctorates). The difference between the two types of programs may be murkier than you think.Here's a breakdown of the two common types of doctorate programs.The Ph.D.: A Research-Oriented DoctorateThese research degrees are commonly referred to as Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.s). Some common research-oriented doctorates include the following:Doctor of Arts (D.A.)Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)Doctor of Theology (Th.D.)Doctor of Public Health (DPH)"Philosophy" refers to the concept of research and pursuit of knowledge, as opposed to the actual subject of philosophy. A core component of this type of degree is the dissertation process.The Professional Doctorate: An Application-Oriented ProgramA professional doctorate (also called an applied doctorate or terminal professional doctorate) is a degree that focuses on the application of a subject within real-world contexts or scenarios.You'll likely want to pursue a professional doctorate if your goals include career advancement, meeting the requirements for specific high-level corporate jobs, establishing teaching credibility within the industry, or building a consulting business.Some common professional doctorates include:Doctor of Business Administration (DBA)Doctor of Education (Ed.D.)Doctor of Healthcare Administration (DHA)Doctor of Professional Studies (DPS)Doctor of Finance (DPH)Doctor of Social Work (DSW)Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.)Juris Doctor (JD)This type of doctorate program may or may not require a dissertation. Unlike the academia-focused research doctorate, the professional doctorate curriculum will encourage you to tackle real-world issues within your field, research, and present a solution.How a Doctoral Degree WorksThe path to a doctoral degree typically comprises four stages of coursework: a core set of research and prep classes, a set of major area emphasis courses, electives and dissertation courses.The Research CoreIn most doctoral programs, you begin the journey to your degree with a common core of classes. The research core establishes the foundational skills you will need to complete the level of work required for the degree.This core often includes advanced writing methods, research methodology and design, applied statistics, colloquium courses, and qualitative and quantitative research and analysis courses.Major Focus AreaOnce the research core is complete, you will typically take courses in your major emphasis of study.For example,If you're earning a DBA (Doctor of Business Administration), you will likely take courses in organizational behavior, organizational systems, strategic thinking and decision making, ethics, and change management.If you're earning a DHA (Doctor of Healthcare Administration), you will likely take courses in healthcare policy and regulations, healthcare economics and finance, quality improvement and process improvement, and health information governance.If you're earning a Ph.D. in Human Services, you will likely take courses in advanced study in research methods for public service, social influences of behavior, ethics in decision making, and advanced communication for the human services leader.ElectivesIn most doctoral programs, you must also take certain electives within your field. Taking electives helps provide a rounded worldview to apply your doctorate in real-world environments.For example, if you're pursuing a Doctor of Education (Ed.D.), you can access focus areas like Higher Education Leadership, PK-12 Educational Leadership and Organizational Leadership.Dissertation RequirementsOnce you have completed your foundation work, major area of focus, and electives, you'll begin working on your dissertation. That can take different forms, determined by the Ph.D. or applied doctorate.For Ph.D. students, the dissertation is typically a five-chapter dissertation, which is commonly broken into three phases. In phase 1, you'll submit a prospectus for approval from the dissertation committee. In phase 2, you'll finalize your dissertation's first chapters and begin collecting data. In phase 3, you'll complete the writing of your dissertation and orally defend it to the program leaders.The dissertation may look different for applied doctorate students, as you will be required to create a solution to a real-world problem.Investigate Dissertation StructuresSince your dissertation will be a crucial hurdle to defeat, you must know what you're getting yourself into from the beginning. Do some research on dissertation structures when you're looking at prospective schools to help narrow down your list. Ensuring the school will do everything to help you succeed with your dissertation can make all the difference when it comes down to crunch time.Franklin University has intentionally designed a dissertation structure to help you complete your dissertation step-by-step, beginning with your enrollment in the program. The University also has built-in faculty mentoring, guidance and peer-to-peer support, so you're never left to "figure it out" alone.For example, throughout your doctoral courses at Franklin, you'll develop essential research skills and the necessary writing prowess to publish a dissertation as a capstone project to your studies. Your dissertation will showcase your ability to identify a topic of interest within the workplace, develop a proposed solution to a problem, and test your hypotheses in the real world.How Long Will It Take to Earn Your Doctoral Degree?The answer depends on the path you choose.A doctoral degree program requires anywhere from 60 to 120 semester credit hours (or approximately 20-40 college classes). Most Ph.D.s require 120 hours, while most applied doctorates are closer to the lower end of that spectrum. For example, the DBA and DHA at Franklin require only 58 hours.On average, a Ph.D. may take up to eight years to complete. A doctorate degree typically takes four to six years to complete—however, this timing depends on the program design, the subject area you're studying, and the institution offering the program.Pro Tip: Some innovative institutions like Franklin University have streamlined their doctorate degree programs and offer creative transfer options. The program design, which includes an embedded dissertation and a community of support, also helps students earn their doctorate in as little as three years.Who is a Good Fit For a Doctoral Program?Other than holding a relevant master's degree or having professional experience, good doctoral students are organized, curious and have the time management skills to manage many tasks in their lives. Doctorate degrees can increase your current wage, open doors to roles in higher education or fulfill a lifelong desire. Many doctoral candidates have full-time jobs and families and are active in their community; therefore, it is vital to have a strong motivation and resilience to pursue a doctorate. However, it is worthwhile because the impact of a doctorate on an individual's career and personal growth can be life-changing. "I went from a successful 27-year career in the electric utility industry to higher education. This change has allowed me to positively affect literally thousands of lives over the past 18 years I have spent as a full-time educator," said Dr. Wendell Seaborne, the Dean of Doctoral Studies & Academic Research at Franklin University. Franklin University provides applied doctorates with 8-week courses and recorded sessions for asynchronous learning designed for working professionals with personal commitments and a dream to make a change. Why Choose to Earn a Doctorate Degree?A doctoral program is a serious commitment with a serious return on investment for master's degree holders.If you want to teach at a higher education institution, the degree is needed to get in the door. If you’d like to move into industry leadership, the degree can deliver substantial credibility. And, if you're eyeing that top-floor corner office, the degree can be a huge differentiator.So, which one is right for you—research or applied?
