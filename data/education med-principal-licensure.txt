  Program Overview





  Lead collaboratively and ethically in order to create an supportive educational environment

You’ll gain an understanding of educational leadership theories, organizational management and strategies for creating a positive and inclusive school culture. Because the M.Ed. curriculum is aligned to the National Educational Leadership Preparation Program (NELP) Recognition Standards, you’ll acquire proven methods to create environments that foster learning by supporting teachers, allocating resources and creating systems conducive to learning and achievement. You’ll also learn about key competencies for success as a leader in education and the significance of constraints like ethics, laws and values. Build productive community and stakeholder relationships School principals often serve as liaisons between the school and the community, parents and other stakeholders. To help you succeed in this role, you’ll learn how to communicate effectively and engage with various groups. Positive relations with stakeholders can serve as a foundation for increased support of the school and ultimately better outcomes for students. Franklin’s master’s in education curriculum incorporates Epstein’s theory on the interdependence of school, family and community to illustrate the importance of creating a school culture that values partnership. You’ll learn how to create a strategic school-based partnership plan or assess an existing plan based on Epstein’s six types of involvement. Apply your knowledge in a school setting The principal licensure program concludes with a 12-week internship under the supervision of a principal within your school or district. You’ll satisfy internship requirements and also add value to the school community by completing a school improvement project on a topic mutually agreed upon by you and your mentor administrator. From student performance improvement projects and bullying intervention to parent and community engagement initiatives, you’ll collect data, draw conclusions and possibly even implement your solutions to challenges facing the administration at your internship site. During the term in which you are completing your internship, you will also be eligible to sit for the Ohio Assessment for Educators exam to receive your principal’s license. Note: To apply for Franklin’s M.Ed.-Principal Licensure program, you must have a valid teaching license. Prior to taking the internship course you must have completed two years of teaching experience. Read more >
