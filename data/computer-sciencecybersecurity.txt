  M.S. in Computer Science - Cybersecurity Focus Overview





  Gain essential knowledge in software delivery, verification and testing

As part of your M.S. in Computer Science-Cybersecurity, you’ll earn a Software Security digital badge that demonstrates your knowledge of software verification and testing and your competency to deliver high-quality software, especially in large complex systems. Through hands-on coursework, you’ll learn how to design and build software to minimize the presence of flaws or mitigate their impacts. You’ll also gain an understanding of important principles in historical and modern cryptography.Learn to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of informationYou’ll dive into the fundamentals of security including risks and vulnerabilities, threat modeling, policy formation, controls and protection methods, encryption and authentication technologies, network security, cryptography, personnel and physical security issues, as well as ethical and legal issues. You’ll emerge with the ability to prescribe defenses against intrusion, recommend access control plans for systems and software, and perform qualitative and quantitative risk assessments.Explore principles in historical and modern cryptographyThe cryptographic primitives of enciphering/deciphering and hashing are the two main methods of protecting information, so mastery of cryptographic techniques is an important skill. You’ll learn to differentiate between basic cryptographic functionality, including symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, block versus stream ciphers, digital signatures and hash functions. Upon completion of the cryptography course, you’ll also be able to combine different cryptographic functions to secure algorithms, contrast various modes of cryptographic algorithms, choose appropriate cryptographic techniques for specific scenarios and summarize attacks on cryptographic primitives.Get course credit for (ISC)2 CSSLP certificationBecause Franklin’s M.S. in Computer Science is aligned with industry competencies, you can get credit toward your degree for relevant certifications. Current (ISC)2 CSSLP certification has been evaluated to be equivalent to ISEC 620, which is a required course for the cybersecurity focus area. The (ISC)2 CSSLP certification provides you with 4 hours of graduate level credit and saves you 12 weeks and $2,680 in tuition. Your admissions advisor can provide guidance on how to submit your credential documentation to receive credit.Read more >

  Admission Requirements

			




The admission process reflects Franklin University’s efforts to clearly identify the performance standards that can help predict student success in graduate level study. The selection criterion for Franklin’s graduate programs, as determined by faculty, emphasizes academic ability, contributory work experience, and personal qualities and characteristics.Requirements for admission include having earned a bachelor's degree from an institution accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges, Western Association of Schools and Colleges (ACCJC), Higher Learning Commission (HLC), Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), New England Commission on Higher Education (NECHE), Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU), Southern Association of Colleges and School Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), or a Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA)-recognized accrediting organization with a GPA of at least a 2.75 on a 4.0 scale.Applicants who earned at least a 2.5 GPA on a 4.0 scale in their earned bachelor’s degree will automatically be granted conditional enrollment status. Applicants who earned lower than a 2.5 GPA on a 4.0 scale in their earned bachelor’s degree can petition for conditional enrollment status to the program chair by submitting an essay detailing other criteria that the applicant believes should be considered to demonstrate their ability to be successful in a graduate program. This petition could include details on the applicant’s work experience, work ethic, level of professionalism, personality characteristics, level of difficulty of program of study previously completed, etc. Conditional enrollment requires students to achieve a final grade of “B” (3.0 GPA) or better in the first graduate-level course of their program. If the terms of the conditional enrollment are not met, the student will not be allowed to advance in their program and will be unable to earn this graduate degree from Franklin University. 




English Language Testing & TOEFL IELTS
Prospective students must demonstrate English Language Proficiency. The requirement is met through any of the following:

The applicant is a citizen of a country where English is the official language.*
The applicant has received a bachelor’s degree (or higher) from an institution located in an English-speaking country in which the courses were taught in English.*
The applicant has earned appropriate scores on language proficiency exams taken within the last two years, as listed in the Academic Catalog.  

*For more information about English proficiency, including a list of English-speaking nations, please visit our International Students section.






Program Advisory Board

The University employs a team approach to planning, developing and maintaining its academic curriculum. An essential element of this process – and a key to the institution’s quality assurance practices – is the Program Advisory Board (and the associated Alumni Advisory Board). A diverse array of business and industry leaders make up these discipline-specific boards that provide guidance on theory-to-practice ideas, global business perspectives, and emerging topics in the field. Each academic year, Program Advisory Boards meet with Division Chairs and faculty for lively and engaged conversations, thus bringing members’ substantial professional experience and expertise into the classroom. In addition, some Division Chairs elect to engage Program Advisory Board members in the assessment of academic program outcomes.
