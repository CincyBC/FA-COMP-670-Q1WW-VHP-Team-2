  Master's in Instructional Design Degree Overview





  Analyze learning needs and design immersive educational experiences

When it comes to performance, successful companies know that skilled, knowledgeable people make the difference. That’s why more and more organizations invest in immersive educational experiences to develop and equip their talent.At the forefront of this human resources revolution are those with an M.S.-Instructional Design & Learning Technology (IDLT) degree. Our transfer-friendly master's in Instructional Design enables students to take a holistic approach to education in a variety of settings. Students learn to analyze learning needs, design appropriate solutions and evaluate the effectiveness of these solutions. And, as it turns out, advancing learning and contributing to the professional development of others may advance your career as well. In fact, job opportunities in the instructional design field are projected to grow by 9 percent over the next decade.*Design instructional interventions that meet learning needsFranklin’s online instructional design master's degree program focuses on instructional design as a means to drive performance improvement. Instructional design focuses on the delivery of transformational training and education solutions to develop the skills and knowledge of workers.In addition to using learning and instructional theory to ensure quality of instruction, our IDLT curriculum also integrates human performance improvement. Related coursework examines the specific causes leading to poor performance, and analyzes how to overcome them by studying how a person operates in a specific setting, which skills they need to be successful, and which strategies will help enable them to succeed.Combined, these two areas will arm you to become a change agent that designs innovative learning and performance improvement strategies that close the gap on an organization’s most pressing performance problems.Gain marketable skills in as few as 16 monthsFranklin’s instructional design master's program curriculum is designed to industry standards, including ATD and ISPI, and teaches you skills highly sought after by employers in these areas: instructional systems design, educational technology, eLearning development, content development, and performance improvement. As a result, you’ll be well prepared to enter or advance your career as an instructional designer, trainer or educator.Plus, you’ll assemble and present a portfolio of work, so you’ll be ready to share actual samples of instructional materials you’ve designed with potential employers. And you will gain hands-on experience with industry software and leverage emerging technologies to design instruction, including e-learning.Franklin University’s masters in instructional design can be completed in as few as 16 months, and you can get started right away because there’s no GRE requirement if you meet certain standards.Earn a relevant degree in sync with your professional development Franklin’s instructional design master's program is a wise choice for pragmatic learning and development professionals. Not only are our faculty scholars, researchers and leaders in the instructional design field, they are all practitioners in the University’s International Institute for Innovative Instruction. The Institute, which has built a reputation for excellence in instructional design and learning assessment through collaborations with partners in a variety of industries, is a testament to the applied nature of Franklin’s IDLT program and knowledge you will gain from our expert faculty. The introductory course helps you to develop a strong basis in the learning theory that you will apply to practical situations throughout the eight-course program. The next six courses can be taken in any order that suits your needs. Once you complete a total of four courses, you will be eligible to receive a Graduate Certificate in Instructional Design, a credential that demonstrates your own commitment to on-going learning and professional development. You’ll conclude the degree program with a 12-week capstone experience that enables you to demonstrate your mastery of the discipline through a comprehensive project working with a client.Another beneficial and unique aspect of the program’s curriculum is the inclusion of a course on project and relationship management. While many master’s-level instructional design programs cover the essentials of designing learning solutions and assessments, few provide the how-tos of managing projects and collaborating in cross-functional groups, which are fundamental skills for effective training and development professionals in today’s dynamic work environments.   *Source information provided by Economic Modeling Specialists International (EMSI)Read more >

  Admission Requirements

			




The admission process reflects Franklin University’s efforts to clearly identify the performance standards that can help predict student success in graduate level study. The selection criterion for Franklin’s graduate programs, as determined by faculty, emphasizes academic ability, contributory work experience, and personal qualities and characteristics.Requirements for admission include having earned a bachelor's degree from an institution accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges, Western Association of Schools and Colleges (ACCJC), Higher Learning Commission (HLC), Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), New England Commission on Higher Education (NECHE), Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU), Southern Association of Colleges and School Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), or a Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA)-recognized accrediting organization with a GPA of at least a 2.75 on a 4.0 scale.Applicants who earned at least a 2.5 GPA on a 4.0 scale in their earned bachelor’s degree will automatically be granted conditional enrollment status. Applicants who earned lower than a 2.5 GPA on a 4.0 scale in their earned bachelor’s degree can petition for conditional enrollment status to the program chair by submitting an essay detailing other criteria that the applicant believes should be considered to demonstrate their ability to be successful in a graduate program.

A diverse array of business and industry leaders make up these discipline-specific boards that provide guidance on theory-to-practice ideas, global business perspectives, and emerging topics in the field. Each academic year, Program Advisory Boards meet with Division Chairs and faculty for lively and engaged conversations, thus bringing members’ substantial professional experience and expertise into the classroom. In addition, some Division Chairs elect to engage Program Advisory Board members in the assessment of academic program outcomes.
