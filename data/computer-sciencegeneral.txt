Program Overview




  Architect the software futures of Fortune 500 companies

If there’s one certainty in business, it’s this: business depends on technology. Which explains why the demand for computer science jobs is at an all-time high. In fact, job growth in the field is projected to increase by an astounding 13% through 2031.*Fortune 500 companies, in particular, need computer science graduates to help them meet their large-scale software needs. That’s because getting their systems solutions right is often the difference between success and failure. These powerhouse organizations rely on qualified practitioners to deliver robust software design, architecture and implementation that increases efficiency and reduces turnaround time, all while maximizing reuse and minimizing rework.Deepen your skills in software design and development with hands-on courseworkFranklin University's transfer-friendly online M.S. in Computer Science (MSCS) program will teach you to interface with organizational stakeholders and translate an evolving set of needs into high-level systems requirements. You'll learn how to integrate new systems within the broader hardware and software environment, too, as well as implement the solution with the agile software engineering process.  Through our practical, hands-on coursework you'll gain experience with leading implementation tools and cutting edge software analysis. And you'll be introduced to other critically needed skills, such as algorithm analysis, distributed systems, verification and testing, and database design.Tailor your master's program around your areas of interestAt Franklin, you can take advantage of elective courses within the master’s in computer science program to align your learning with your interests.Concentrate your electives to pursue focus areas in Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, or Software Systems and prepare for specialized roles, or integrate your choices among all three areas to personalize the program and broaden your knowledge base. Other elective options include internship and independent study opportunities.Our Computer Science master's degree program curriculum is regularly reviewed by an advisory board strongly represented by leading companies in industry, including Herb Berger, Director, Enterprise Architecture for Cardinal Health. That means what you learn at Franklin is relevant to the needs of the industry now and stays relevant over time.Get credit for what you know, finish faster and lower your degree cost Because Franklin’s technology programs align with industry competencies, you can get prior learning credit toward two M.S. in Computer Science elective courses for certifications. A current (ISC)2 CISSP equates to Information Assurance (ISEC 610) and (ISC)2 CSSLP has been evaluated to be equivalent to Software and App Security (ISEC 620). Either of these certifications translate into 4 credit hours toward your degree and $2,680 in tuition savings or 8 credits and $5,360 if you have both.Have another credential not listed here? Check our prior learning database to see if it has been evaluated for credit.  In addition to awarding prior learning credit for credentials, the University also awards transfer credit for previous credit earned at other accredited institutions. You can transfer up to 12 credits – a 30% cost savings – toward your degree, through certifications, previous coursework or a combination. To see if your previous coursework can be used for course-for-course credit to satisfy degree requirements, you’ll need to submit a syllabus for the course(s) you’d like to have evaluated for transfer credit and/or your credential documentation. Your admissions advisor will be happy to assist you in any way.  Earn your degree from a university built for busy adultsEarn your degree on your terms by taking classes 100% online.

How can software be designed and built to minimize the presence of flaws or mitigate their impacts?  This course focuses on software development processes that identify, model, and mitigate threats to all kinds of software.  Topics include threat modeling frameworks, attack trees, attack libraries, defensive tactics, secure software development lifecycle, web, cloud, and human factors.
CYSC 640 - Cryptography  (4)
The cryptographic primitives of enciphering/deciphering and hashing are the two main methods of preserving confidentiality and integrity of data at rest and in transit. As such, the study of cryptographic techniques is of primary interest to security practitioners. This course will cover the important principles in historical and modern cryptography including the underlying information theory, mathematics, and randomness.  Important technologies such as stream and block ciphers, symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, public key infrastructure, and key exchange will be explored. Finally, hashing and message authentication codes will be examined as a way of preserving data integrity.

  Admission Requirements

			




The admission process reflects Franklin University’s efforts to clearly identify the performance standards that can help predict student success in graduate level study. The selection criterion for Franklin’s graduate programs, as determined by faculty, emphasizes academic ability, contributory work experience, and personal qualities and characteristics.Requirements for admission include having earned a bachelor's degree from an institution accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges, Western Association of Schools and Colleges (ACCJC), Higher Learning Commission (HLC), Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), New England Commission on Higher Education (NECHE), Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU), Southern Association of Colleges and School Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), or a Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA)-recognized accrediting organization with a GPA of at least a 2.75 on a 4.0 scale.Applicants who earned at least a 2.5 GPA on a 4.0 scale in their earned bachelor’s degree will automatically be granted conditional enrollment status. Applicants who earned lower than a 2.5 GPA on a 4.0 scale in their earned bachelor’s degree can petition for conditional enrollment status to the program chair by submitting an essay detailing other criteria that the applicant believes should be considered to demonstrate their ability to be successful in a graduate program. This petition could include details on the applicant’s work experience, work ethic, level of professionalism, personality characteristics, level of difficulty of program of study previously completed, etc. Conditional enrollment requires students to achieve a final grade of “B” (3.0 GPA) or better in the first graduate-level course of their program. If the terms of the conditional enrollment are not met, the student will not be allowed to advance in their program and will be unable to earn this graduate degree from Franklin University. 




English Language Testing & TOEFL IELTS
Prospective students must demonstrate English Language Proficiency. The requirement is met through any of the following:

The applicant is a citizen of a country where English is the official language.*
The applicant has received a bachelor’s degree (or higher) from an institution located in an English-speaking country in which the courses were taught in English.*
The applicant has earned appropriate scores on language proficiency exams taken within the last two years, as listed in the Academic Catalog.  

*For more information about English proficiency, including a list of English-speaking nations, please visit our International Students section.






Program Advisory Board

The University employs a team approach to planning, developing and maintaining its academic curriculum. An essential element of this process – and a key to the institution’s quality assurance practices – is the Program Advisory Board (and the associated Alumni Advisory Board). A diverse array of business and industry leaders make up these discipline-specific boards that provide guidance on theory-to-practice ideas, global business perspectives, and emerging topics in the field. Each academic year, Program Advisory Boards meet with Division Chairs and faculty for lively and engaged conversations, thus bringing members’ substantial professional experience and expertise into the classroom. In addition, some Division Chairs elect to engage Program Advisory Board members in the assessment of academic program outcomes.
