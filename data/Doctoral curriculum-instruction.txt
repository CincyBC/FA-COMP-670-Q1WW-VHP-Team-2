Our per credit hour tuition rates (vs. per year or per term rates) enable you to get a realistic estimate of exactly how much your degree will cost. Our 2024-2025 tuition rate is $748 per credit hour. Use Franklin’s free MyCost Estimator to get a personalized estimate of the total cost of your education in Instructional Design Leadership (Ed.D.-IDL) with a focus on curriculum and instruction. If you have any questions, ask our helpful staff about available financing options and financial aid programs.




		How long does it take to get an Ed.D. in Curriculum and Instruction?
		


At Franklin, if you complete two courses per term, you could finish your online doctoral program in curriculum in instruction in 2 years. Ambitious, hard-working students can complete their dissertation research in 1 year; however, it is not uncommon for students to extend their research beyond 12 months. The good news is that you determine how quickly you finish your dissertation research.
