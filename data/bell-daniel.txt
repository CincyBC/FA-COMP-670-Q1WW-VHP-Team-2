Profile
Dr. Bell is the Program Chair for Franklin University's Bachelor of Science in Interactive Media Design. In addition to teaching IMD courses, Dr. Bell has pioneered the infusion of real projects from organizations in the community into the classroom to give students real-world experience not afforded in typical college courses. Dr. Bell teaches, conducts research, and consults in the fields of interaction design and game-based learning. During his career, Dr. Bell has championed the use of interactive media as a method to improve learning and increasing access to those facing limitations of time and location. His work has led to collaboration with universities across the country, as well as the U.S. Department of Commerce. Dr. Bells' research is focused on the use of Real-World Projects and the creation of Game-Based learning and is the founder of the newly formed International Game-Based Learning Association, focused on improving teaching and learning through the use of games and simulations. Dr. Bell has recently returned from Poland where he participated in an EU funded project to incorporate games into higher education instruction for several Polish Universities.
