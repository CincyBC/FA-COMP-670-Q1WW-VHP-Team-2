This exam requires additional technology, if student uses online proctoring.





				Focus Area			



Learning Technology:

IDPT 601 - Foundations of Instructional Design (4)
Learning theories and instructional design models are the two fundamental pillars for the field of instructional design. In this course, students will study the learning theories and philosophies that have formed, influence, and support this field. Students will also study instructional systems theories, models, and systematic approaches to instructional design. In this course, students will apply these theories, strategies, and instructional models to create a learning, instructional design, or training event in their chosen setting, whether business, government, healthcare, higher ed, industry, k-12, or other. At the end of this course, students will make a plan on how to prepare for an instructional design career.

IDPT 645 - Learning Management Systems (4)
In this course, students will study the practices employed to manage and deliver instructional content in an online environment. Students will interact with a functional Learning Management System (LMS) to manage the design, development, delivery, and evaluation of reusable learning content.


																					OR																			
Healthcare:

HIM 702 - Health Information Governance (4)
This course covers the broad spectrum of strategic issues in healthcare including policies, guidelines, standards, processes, and controls required to manage and implement enterprise-level information. Treating information as a strategic asset to healthcare organizations, processes to manage various risks to the quality of information and ensure its appropriate use are covered.
HIM 710 - Clinical Workflow & Applications (4)
This course explores requirements for clinical workflows in a variety of inpatient, outpatient, and emergency healthcare environments. It covers the documentation, review, mapping, and diagramming of clinical workflow information and processes.

It covers the techniques of extracting, transforming and loading data from a myriad of operational databases into corporate data warehouses, as well means to ensure that decision making is based on clean and reliable information. The course also includes ways to report the healthcare intelligence gathered.


																					OR																			
Cybersecurity:

CYSC 630 - Information Risk Management (4)
When audits, technology, or compliance become the driver for security initiatives the resulting program is strategically fragmented, reactive, and rigid. Moreover, there are few, if any, assurances that the biggest threats are being addressed.  On the other hand, risk assessment places values on assets, evaluates the current controls, and provides data to improve the protection in a controlled, proactive, and flexible manner.  This course teaches an approach to security that combines operational security, risk assessment, test and review and mitigation such that value can be demonstrated. A project-based approach to risk assessment is followed including, project definition and preparation, data gathering, technical information, physical data gathering, analysis, mitigation, recommendations, and reporting. Note, this course has proctored exam(s).
CYSC 650 - Advanced Network Security (4)
Networks connecting disparate devices, services, and users have been among the most ubiquitous technologies that have led to the spectacular economic and technical success of the Internet. Today, networks seem to disappear, only to receive attention when they fail or are breached by attackers. While firewalls and virtual private networks are mainstays of network security, a strategy built on these alone is insufficient. This course covers a more comprehensive and systematic approach to network security including monitoring, incident response, forensics, virtualization and cloud, secure protocols, cryptography, and web services
CYSC 670 - Ethical Hacking (4)
When most people think of information security the images that come to mind are those of hackers: secretive people who, for political or profit motives, illegally break into computer systems to steal data or cause mayhem. While that kind of criminal element does exist, ethical hackers provide a needed service to organizations seeking to test and refine their security plans and technologies. This course takes an in-depth approach to ethical hacking including reconnaissance, scanning, vulnerability analysis, exploitation, and reporting. Students will employ current tools and methods in a hands-on approach that also prepares them for the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) exam. Note, this course has proctored exam(s).


																					OR																			
Data Analytics:

MATH 601 - Introduction to Analytics (4)
This course provides an introductory overview of methods, concepts, and current practices in the growing field of statistics and data analytics.

ACCT 729 - Financial & Managerial Accounting (4)
Effective leadership in today's complex and highly regulated business environment demands more than a working knowledge of basic accounting practices. Managers must fully grasp sophisticated financial and managerial accounting concepts and be able to apply them with ease in handling day-to-day responsibilities. Managers must also be well versed in the intricacies of corporate governance and asset protection. In this course, students will develop a clear understanding of these critical functions and issues. Students will study the foundational aspects of financial accounting, including professional structure, the interrelationships of financial statements, and multiple forms of financial analysis.
