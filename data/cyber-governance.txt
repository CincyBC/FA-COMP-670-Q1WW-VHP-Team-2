  Cyber Governance Certificate Courses & Curriculum




				16 Semester Hours
			


				Major Area Required			




CYSC 600 - Intro to Cybersecurity Fundamentals (4)
Designed specifically for graduate students from diverse backgrounds, this course demystifies the complex world of cybersecurity, making it accessible and engaging for those without prior technical expertise. Focusing on critical thinking, the course explores security via people, processes, and technology and will introduce, define, and apply general cybersecurity information. Additional topics include legal compliance and governance, ethics and privacy, basic risk management, and personal and professional awareness and safety. Emphasis is on the critical sectors which allows for industry-specific application of concepts relevant to the students? programs of study.
OR CYSC 610 - Information Assurance (4)
This course covers the fundamentals of security in the enterprise environment. Included are coverage of risks and vulnerabilities, threat modeling, policy formation, controls and protection methods, encryption and authentication technologies, network security, cryptography, personnel and physical security issues, as well as ethical and legal issues. This foundational course serves as an introduction to many of the subsequent topics discussed in depth in later security courses. Note, this course has proctored exam(s). This exam requires additional technology, if student uses online proctoring.


																					AND																			

CYSC 630 - Information Risk Management (4)
When audits, technology, or compliance become the driver for security initiatives the resulting program is strategically fragmented, reactive, and rigid. Moreover, there are few, if any, assurances that the biggest threats are being addressed.  On the other hand, risk assessment places values on assets, evaluates the current controls, and provides data to improve the protection in a controlled, proactive, and flexible manner.  This course teaches an approach to security that combines operational security, risk assessment, test and review and mitigation such that value can be demonstrated. A project-based approach to risk assessment is followed including, project definition and preparation, data gathering, technical information, physical data gathering, analysis, mitigation, recommendations, and reporting. Note, this course has proctored exam(s).


CYSC 660 - Cybercrime, Ethics, and Privacy (4)
The prevalence of data breaches, identity theft, and the dark net today makes the study of digital cybercrime, ethics, and compliance highly relevant to information security. Laws related to intellectual property, privacy, and criminal and civil proceedings will be discussed. Ethical behavior and frameworks for navigating between customer and business concerns in the workplace are also emphasized.


CYSC 680 - Information Security Policy & Governance (4)
As organizations have fallen victim to the proliferation of cyberattacks in recent years, many have responded reactively, thereby developing a posture that "wins the previous war." However, regulations and laws are now necessitating a more proactive stance. Organizations that can develop an effective security strategy stand to gain as they balance business with security. This course is about leading organizations in developing an effective information security program via policies, frameworks, architecture, standards, organizational hierarchies, controls and metrics with the end goal being a proactive security posture tailored to the specific business needs.
