Pathways for Business Professionals.Doctor of Business AdministrationBusiness professionals constantly seek ways to stay ahead of the competition, enhance their leadership skills and drive innovation.One way to achieve this is through advanced education, such as a doctoral degree in business.But is a doctorate in business the right path for you? What does it entail, and how can it benefit your career? Below, we'll explore the options available for business professionals interested in pursuing the highest level of academic achievement within the field.Understanding Doctoral Degrees in BusinessDoctoral degrees in business administration are designed for those who want to deepen their knowledge of business theories, conduct research and apply advanced principles to real-world challenges.However, not every doctoral degree is created the same.There are two main types of business doctoral degrees to be aware of: the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) and the Ph.D. in Business. The former focuses on the practical application of research, whereas the latter is more theory-driven and academically oriented.More details on these degrees will be provided below.Types of Doctoral Degrees in BusinessWhen considering a business administration doctorate, weighing the differences between doctoral programs is essential.“The DBA emphasizes the practical application of research to address real-world business challenges. It is tailored for experienced professionals who seek to apply advanced research methods to improve business practices, drive innovative solutions and enhance their leadership capabilities,” says Dr. Robin Hinkle, department chair of doctoral programs and DBA program chair at Franklin University.“In contrast, a Ph.D. in Business is more academically oriented, concentrating on developing new theories, original research and knowledge within the field. It's ideal for those pursuing academic careers, such as teaching and conducting theoretical research.”While both degrees are valuable, it's important to note that they cater to different professional goals.A DBA is ideal for business leaders, consultants and executives who want to implement evidence-based strategies in their organizations. Meanwhile, the Ph.D. is designed for those who are passionate about academic research and business theory and who want to contribute to the cumulative knowledge of the business world.Bonus Resource:DBA vs Ph.D.: Which is Right for You?Who Should Consider a Business Administration Doctoral Program?“A DBA degree program is ideal for seasoned professionals seeking to enhance their strategic leadership capabilities, solve complex business challenges or advance to executive roles within their industry,” says Dr. Hinkle.

These programs focus on practical research, leadership development and the application of advanced business theories to solve contemporary challenges.What to Expect from a DBA ProgramDBA programs typically consist of a combination of coursework and research that's completed over a set period of time. It can be broken down as follows:Coursework. DBA students complete numerous courses focused on organizational leadership, business analytics and strategy, innovation and research methods. These courses are designed to provide a strong foundation in both theory and practice.Research and Practical Application. A significant portion of a DBA program involves conducting research that addresses real-world business challenges. Dr. Hinkle explains that some common research areas include:Organizational Change. Research may focus on change management strategies, leadership models or improving organizational efficiency.Strategic Decision-Making. Projects might involve analyzing business data to inform strategic decisions or exploring new market opportunities.Business Innovation. DBA candidates often explore how to foster innovation within organizations through leadership, culture or technology.Timeframe and Commitment. Completing a DBA program usually takes 3-4 years, depending on the student's pace and time commitment. Working professionals can expect to dedicate 15-20 hours per week to their studies, with additional time needed for dissertation research.  Specializations and Focus AreasMost DBA programs allow students to specialize in a particular area of interest. These specializations are designed to provide students with in-depth knowledge and skills tailored to their career goals.For example, some schools offer leadership add-ons as part of their DBA. This specialization equips students with the skills to lead organizational development and change management initiatives.Other common specializations that can accompany a DBA include:Leadership and Strategy. Focuses on organizational leadership, culture and change management.Finance and Accounting. Covers advanced financial management, auditing and corporate finance.Marketing and International Business. Includes global marketing strategies, consumer behavior and international business practices.  Benefits of Earning a Doctorate in Business AdministrationCareer Advancement OpportunitiesLightcast projects strong growth in the United States for positions typically held by business doctorate holders through 2033. Financial managers, for instance, are expected to see a 21.3% increase in demand, and marketing managers by 15.1%. Overall, doctorate-level careers, which offer an average salary of $100,700 in the United States, are expected to grow by 12.5%, contributing to over 47,573 job openings each year.Dr. Hinkle says that a DBA can help candidates capitalize on these career opportunities, as a doctoral degree can significantly enhance professional credibility, increase competitiveness in the job market and bolster effectiveness in executive decision-making roles.This being said, some of the most common career paths for DBA graduates include:Leadership Roles. Many DBA holders go on to become CEOs, COOs or senior executives.Teaching and Academic Positions. Some graduates pursue academic careers, teaching business leadership and management at universities.Consulting and Advisory Roles. DBA graduates are highly valued in consulting firms, providing insights into leadership and business strategy. Advisory may be required across various industries, including business, tech and/or healthcare management.  Impact on Earning PotentialOne of the most compelling reasons to pursue a DBA is the potential for increased earning power.For example, earning a DBA can significantly boost your salary compared to professionals with only a master’s degree.According to Lightcast data, those with a master’s degree in business-related fields typically earn an average annual salary of around $74,500. In contrast, professionals holding a doctorate can earn well over $100,700 annually, depending on their role, industry and experience level.The increased earning potential, enhanced job opportunities and the prestige of holding a doctorate make pursuing a DBA a potentially valuable investment in one's future.How to Choose the Right Doctoral Business Administration ProgramChoosing the right DBA program requires careful consideration of several factors, including the program's accreditation, reputation, flexibility and support for working professionals.Accreditation and Reputation“Careful research into various DBA programs is essential to identify one that matches a student's professional background, interests and career aspirations,” says Dr. Hinkle. And finding a reputable and esteemed program is an important part of this process.Accreditation ensures that a DBA program meets high academic standards. For example, academic institutions accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) are highly recognized and respected by employers.Flexibility and Support for Working ProfessionalsBalancing a doctoral program with professional and personal responsibilities can be challenging, but many DBA programs focus on providing flexibility to aspiring graduates. Online programs, for example, allow students to complete their coursework remotely, making it easier to balance work, life and study.“It’s crucial to assess the time and financial commitment involved, including balancing academic responsibilities with personal obligations and exploring available funding options,” notes Dr. Hinkle.
