Profile

Dr. Hinkle is the Program Chair for the Doctor of Business Administration at Franklin University. Previously, she served as Associate Professor and Director of the Master of Science in Business Communication (MSBC) program at Spalding University in Louisville, Kentucky. In addition to teaching in the MSBC program, she oversaw the promotion and day-to-day operations of the program. During her 10 years in that position, she developed and implemented four new concentrations, as well as certificate programs. She is accustomed to working with adjunct teaching faculty. A large part of her role was interacting and recruiting the proper talent for each course, training, maintaining positive relationships with each one, and monitoring their performance.  

Dr. Hinkle previously taught at the University of Louisville. In addition, she brings a wealth of business, marketing, consulting, and human resource experience. She has worked for various organizations, including Humana and the US Army Research Institute. Her research areas are organizational leadership, self-awareness, and business ethics. Apart from academics, Robin is a board member of A Hand Up, a local non-profit that teaches financial literacy. She has also served as Regional President for the Great Lakes Region of IACBE, to which Franklin University belongs.

She is a certified Genos Emotional Intelligence practitioner. She holds a B.A. in Government, an M.B.A. in International Business, and an M.S. in Organizational Behavior—all from The University of Texas at Dallas. She also holds a Ph.D. in Leadership and Organizational Development from the University of Louisville.
