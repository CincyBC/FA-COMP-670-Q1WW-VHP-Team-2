Process for Student Concerns
The University expects the highest standards of behavior and conduct of each member of the campus community. In some instances, missteps occur that are detrimental to maintaining honesty and integrity, respect of others, and the respect of the campus community. The University Student Grievance Process is an administrative process designed to provide a way for a member of our campus community to identify instances that disrupt the academic community and request a formal review.

 

A grievance is a complaint, accusation, or concern a member of the campus community has about their experiences with one or more individuals in the campus community, or by the University as a whole. It may involve a one-time occurrence, a pattern of experiences that has had a negative impact on a community memberâ€™s experience with Franklin, or a basic decision made in the normal course of operations that the student believes was made capriciously or has a disparate impact on the student relative to others.

 

The formal Grievance Process is facilitated by the Department of Student Affairs and should be initiated only after efforts to resolve issues directly are exhausted. The Office of Community Standards takes leadership of the Grievance Process and facilitates the initial review and determines the outcome of the investigation. Any member of the campus community may initiate the Grievance Process by submitting a completed Grievance Form with appropriate documentation.
