Program Overview



Learn processes and technologies key to data analytics and increase your value in the workplace Until recently, accounting professionals spent significant time manually analyzing data and performing repetitive tasks. In the ever-evolving business environment, employers expect accountants to be familiar with data analytics and processing tools. You’ll gain hands-on practice with Excel, Python and Tableau, get an introduction to data manipulation and visualization, and learn how to use data analytics to fuel decision making.Learn from case studies that combine data analytics and accounting knowledge Rather than simply preparing and reporting information, nearly all CPAs rely on data analytics skills. Auditors use data analytics to enable continuous monitoring, continuous auditing and analysis of full data sets from audited samples. CFOs and finance leaders use big data to discover patterns in customer behavior and market trends to drive company strategy. Real-world scenarios included in the certificate curriculum connect the dots to illustrate how data analytics fundamentals, including business problem framing, data wrangling, descriptive and inferential statistics, data visualization and data storytelling in analytics, can be used to improve results in a variety of accounting roles.Earn a unique accounting and data analytics certificate in as few as 12 months  As data analysis continues to become a more significant part of accounting responsibilities, the Accounting Data Analytics certificate provides theoretical and practical expertise to help you reach your goals. Whether you are a bachelor’s-degree student looking for a competitive edge in the  job market, or an experienced professional who wants to upskill and add to your value in your organization, the certificate is a great investment in your future. The certificate can be completed in as few as 12 months by taking a combination of 6- and 12-week courses. Moreover, the certificate, designed for accounting professionals, is more accessible than similar certificates that require a master’s degree or a CPA designation. In fact, if earning a CPA designation is part of your plan, the certificate is a win-win. The 16 hours you’ll receive as part of completing the certificate will count toward the 150-hour requirement, as currently proposed by the Ohio Society of CPAs, that must be met before a CPA can be licensed. Earn an Accounting Data Analytics Certificate from a university built for busy adultsEarn your Accounting Data Analytics Certificate on your terms by taking classes 100% online. Accredited and nonprofit, Franklin was built from the ground-up to satisfy the needs of adult learners. Our seamless transfer process and team of academic advisors will help ease your transition to becoming a student, while our flexible course schedules help to balance your education with work, family and life.
