  M.S. in Nursing-Nurse Administrator Degree Overview





  Expand your career opportunities with a nursing master’s focused on administration

As healthcare delivery continues to grow more complex, nurses in leadership roles play a critical role in improving patient outcomes, realizing operational efficiencies and preparing for the challenges that lie ahead. Nurse leaders are being sought in all facets of healthcare, from hospitals and clinics, to community and public agencies, to industries like insurance and higher education, in order to lend insight into long-term planning and quality improvement initiatives. Not only will the M.S. in Nursing-Nurse Administrator track enable you to broaden your professional impact, the transition from patient-care to a managerial position may also afford you a more flexible work schedule and a multitude of career options in a variety of settings. As a graduate-level nursing student, you will strengthen your critical thinking and problem-solving skills in order to lead healthcare in the future. You’ll examine the advanced role of the nurse leader in the administration of healthcare delivery, management of change and interdisciplinary collaboration. You’ll earn your degree in as few as 16 months, by completing 6-week online courses. You’ll conclude your studies with a 12-week practicum that will be completed on-site in a healthcare setting. Tailor your studies to your career interests with elective courses As part of Franklin’s commitment to providing a relevant education, you’ll have the opportunity to hone your administrative skills in areas that best meet your needs. Explore functional business areas like accounting and finance, operations management or human resources through the healthcare lens. Other topics of interest include health law and ethics and health information management. If you have a desire to lead in a government or non-profit setting, you may benefit from several elective options at the graduate level in public administration. Courses outside of the major area do more than provide you with a fresh perspective. Your instructors and classmates are in-field practitioners and experts with professional backgrounds and experiences different than your own. These interactions effectively model real-world scenarios in which nurse administrators routinely collaborate across organizations.Position yourself for advancement faster with an MSN that fits your lifeFranklin’s M.S. in Nursing-Nurse Administrator track is designed to accommodate the schedules of ambitious working RNs, so the coursework structure enables you to apply your real-world experiences in the classroom, thereby reducing your practicum requirement to 80 hours. Not only is this fewer hours than are required in many graduate-level nurse administrator programs, you’ll also be able to complete many of these hours outside of the practicum agency as you develop your project. Because we honor the learning you’ve already done, you may also be able to satisfy some of the elective requirements with previously completed graduate-level management courses from another university or with professional certifications like CCRN, CEN or OCN.Earn an accredited nursing degree The master's degree program in nursing at Franklin University is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (http://www.ccneaccreditation.org).Transfer up to 12 credits and finish your MSN fasterIf you have previously taken MSN courses at a CCNE-accredited institution, you may be able to transfer credit and save time and money toward your Franklin MSN. Franklin offers course-for-course credit for advanced pathophysiology, advanced pharmacology and advanced physical assessment, as long as they have been completed within 3 to 5 years of your enrollment at Franklin. To see if your previous coursework can be used to satisfy degree requirements, you’ll need to submit a syllabus for the course(s) you’d like to have evaluated for transfer credit. Your admissions advisor will be happy to assist you in any way.  Read more >
