  FNP or AGPCNP: Which is the Best Fit for You?




Nursing is a challenging, yet rewarding profession that affords you the opportunity to follow your passion in a rapidly evolving and growing industry. If you are deciding between the Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) and Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner (AGPCNP), there are some important similarities between the two programs. Both specializations:

Require 600 clinical hours and completion of Primary Care I (NURS 701/701C) + Primary Care II  (NURS 702/702C)
Are nationally certified through American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) or American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP)
Equip you for positions in ambulatory care centers, medical offices and correctional facilities

However, below you’ll find some information on what differentiates the two options. Compare the options and find the best fit for you.

  DNP-AGPCNP Frequently Asked Questions






		What is a DNP degree? 
		


A DNP or Doctor of Nursing Practice degree is a clinical practice degree, and is different from the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Nursing degree, which is a research degree.




		What can you do with a DNP degree? 
		


Plenty! As a DNP graduate, you’ll be prepared to hold a variety of job positions and roles in leadership, administration, informatics and, if you’re prepared as a nurse practitioner, advanced practice.




		Why get a DNP degree?
		


If you want to become an advanced nursing leader, a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) is considered the terminal degree for clinical practice.




		What makes Franklin’s DNP degree unique? 
		


Franklin streamlines your educational experience. We’ll help you finish faster and let you practice what you learn while you learn – thanks to embedded practicum hours and a scholarly project that are included within our courses.




		How long is an online DNP program?
		


Congratulations on wanting to advance your education and career through Franklin’s Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree program! The Franklin online DNP is designed for busy nurses, so, depending on your previous education and area of focus, you may be able to complete your terminal degree in 6-11 trimesters (24-48 months).




		When can I start a DNP degree?
		


Getting started with your Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP degree) is easy and convenient at Franklin. We offer two start dates a year in fall and spring. Talk to your admissions advisor to find the start date that's right for you.




		How much will my DNP degree cost?
		


At Franklin, you’ll get a quality education at a competitive cost so you can afford to invest in your future right now. Our helpful staff can talk with you about flexible financing options as well as financial aid programs. See current tuition and rates here.




		Do I need to have an MSN before starting a DNP program?
		


Good news! The answer is “no.” You can be admitted to the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree program through Franklin’s BSN to DNP pathway. With this pathway, you will take two bridge courses (NURS 800 and NURS 805) first. Once you successfully complete these courses, you will be fully admitted to the DNP program. By the way, this is the same pathway that anyone with a BSN and a non-nursing master’s degree would follow for the DNP degree.




		For the BSN to DNP degree, will I also earn the MSN degree? 
		


No. However, as a prerequisite to full admission to the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program, you will complete two bridge courses that cover foundational knowledge from the M.S. in Nursing (MSN) program.   




		How will I complete the practicum hours for the DNP?  
		


Practicum hours focus on skill development in essential areas, including leadership, informatics, finance and patient safety. Some of your practicum hours will be completed at a practicum site with a preceptor to guide your work. Other hours are considered experiential and will be facilitated by a faculty member as part of your coursework. In addition, as part of your practicum, you will develop a scholarly project using an evidence-based intervention and quality improvement framework that addresses a gap in practice, process, or policy at your practice site. Bottom line? You’ll be able to complete about half of your practicum hours during your coursework!




		If I complete the FNP at the same time as the DNP, will I have to do clinical hours?  
		


Yes. You will complete 600 clinical hours in the Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) specialty at a medical office or clinic.




		What is an Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner?
		


Adult-gerontology nurse practitioners (AGNP) treat patients from adolescence (typically from age 13) through old age. The AGNP specialty promotes and sustains health in the community and workplace, with particular emphasis on culturally diverse and high-risk populations. Faculty members prepare AGPCNPs to assess and manage the health care of adolescents, adults and older adults with common acute and multiple chronic conditions.




		What can you do with a DNP-Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner degree?
		


Adult-gerontology nurse practitioners specialize in comprehensive healthcare for adults across the lifespan from adolescence (13) to end of life; they may work in primary care or acute care.




		Why get a DNP-Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner degree?
		


In addition to nursing fundamentals, Adult-gerontology nurse practitioners have an intimate understanding of the aging process. Their education and practice focuses on serving those patients 13 years of age and older in dealing with the unique medical challenges that occur in the later chapters of one’s life. The AGNP will often serve as the go-to medical provider for patients over the long term, typically taking a wellness-based and holistic approach to medical care and functioning as the familiar point of contact for routine medical visits.
