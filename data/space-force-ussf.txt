  Space Force: Guardian's Tuition Assistance Program



The Space Force's educational Tuition Assistance (TA) benefits are available to active-duty & guard members seeking undergraduate or graduate coursework. 









  Program Details




Guardians are awarded TA to pay for college courses up to $250 per semester hour and are capped at $4,500 per fiscal year. Franklin University offers an undergraduate tuition discount for currently enlisted Guardians at $250 per credit hour. The graduate-level tuition discount is offered at $536 per credit hour. Contact the Air Force Virtual Education Office or visit your education base to complete a Department of Defense Request for Tuition Assistance. Completing this form will start you on your way to earning a degree. You must request TA for each course no sooner than forty-five days before the class begins and no later than seven days before the course officially starts.  After the TA authorization form is completed and signed, please email it to OMVA@franklin.edu to ensure prompt processing of your benefits. As a reminder, course material fees, such as e-book charges, are always student-funded. Tuition Assistance does not pay for student-funded course materials.
