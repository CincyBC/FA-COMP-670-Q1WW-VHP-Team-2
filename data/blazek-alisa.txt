Profile
Dr. Alisa Blazek is an experienced scientific researcher, project manager, and operations manager with demonstrated success in managing projects and in multidisciplinary team building in health care and software development industries. Her formal training consists of a master’s degree in Exercise Science and a Ph.D. in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, both from The Ohio State University. Her M.A. thesis focused on altitude's effects on the mucosal immune system of athletes, and her Ph.D. dissertation focused on molecular mediators of bone and muscle crosstalk with exercise. She also obtained a certificate in Data Science from Thinkful online. 

Dr. Blazek spent much of her career as a biological scientist and program manager in various positions at Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, OH, and has also held positions in data science and analytics. She is developing Kinesight Fitness, LLC, a company that aims to use machine learning and molecular biomarkers to program fitness and perform exercise science research.  

Dr. Blazek has been teaching Exercise Science courses at Franklin University since 2020, and has experience teaching courses and labs in Kinesiology, Exercise Physiology, Exercise Testing, and other Exercise Science classes both at Franklin and The Ohio State University. She enjoys using novel technologies to study exercise and appreciates the importance of understanding molecular mechanisms in exercise research.
