  Tuition Payment Plans & Options



It’s nice to have options when it comes to paying for college tuition -- and Franklin offers plenty of them. In addition to financial aid, we offer installment payment plans, deferred tuition reimbursement and direct company billing. Plus, we make it convenient to make payments online through myFranklin.




Important Dates & Deadlines

All business-related forms should be submitted prior to the first day of class. All documents and forms may be submitted by email, fax, or USPS mail.










  Scheduled Payment Plans




How it works:
Avoid late payments with Franklin’s installment payment plan. With this plan, you make monthly payments throughout the trimester without having to pay your full tuition balance at the beginning of the term.
Who can use it:
You’re eligible for this payment plan if you:

Personally pay for any portion of your tuition and fees, and
Cannot pay your balance before the first day of classes.

How do I apply:
Each trimester, log in to myFranklin and choose the payment plan from your payment options that best fits your need.  If you need your current balance put into a payment plan, then choose the current balance payment plan.  If you know a portion of your balance will be covered by another financing source that has not applied to your account yet, then choose the self-determined payment plan.  
 







  Deferred Tuition Payment




How it works:
If your employer offers tuition reimbursement benefits, Franklin can defer your tuition payment for the current trimester. Once grades are posted and your employer makes payment to you, log in to myFranklin to make your tuition payment.
Who can use it:
You’re eligible for this payment plan if your employer pays for college coursework through an employee tuition reimbursement program.
How do I apply:
You must obtain proper authorization from your employer. Visit myFranklin payment options to submit Franklin’s Employer Tuition Reimbursement application. You must submit the application each term you want to defer your tuition payment.







  Direct Company Billing




How it works:
With this option, your employer or other agency pays your college tuition directly to Franklin and will provide you with a letter of credit or voucher to give to Franklin’s Student Financial Services Office. 
Who can use it:
You're eligible for this payment option if your employer offers to pay Franklin directly for your college education.
How do I apply:
Once your employer gives you the letter of credit or voucher with the details of what they will pay on your behalf, then submit the form to Franklin's Student Financial Services Office.  
When do I apply:
Submit a letter of credit or voucher to the Student Financial Services Office before the start of classes each trimester.







  Ways To Pay




You may pay your tuition balance with a MasterCard®, Visa®, Discover®, AmericanExpress®, personal check, cashier’s check, money order, or international funds transfer. Payments can be made online through your myFranklin account with a checking or savings account, debit or credit card information, linked 529 account, or wire transfer for foreign currency. 
The University has provided a secure server so you can safely make financial transactions on the e-Payment site.
You can access this site by logging into myFranklin and clicking on "Payment Options" next to the "Total Amount Due" from your account summary.
 
If you are paying with a credit/debit card, then a convenience fee will be assessed. Each 529 payment made from a linked account will be assessed a $10 service fee. To avoid the convenience fee and service fee, please pay using the electronic check option which will ask for your checking/savings account & routing number.
Checks and money orders can be dropped off in person at the University’s Welcome Center or mailed to the University’s Business Office at:
Franklin University
201 S. Grant Ave.
Columbus, OH 43215
If an employer or agency is paying Franklin directly, then submit the letter of credit or voucher to the Student Financial Services Office.
All tuition and fees are due by the first day of class. In the event you are unable to pay your full balance by the deadline of the first day of class, then you can enroll in a monthly installment plan administered by the University. The installment plan allows you to break up your balance for the term into monthly payments to avoid administrative restrictions on your account and potential finance charges.







  Additional Information





			
  Tuition Payment Deadline Information

			


Tuition is due the first day of class. An account is considered delinquent after the first day of class and could be placed on administrative restriction due to nonpayment.

  Dishonored Payments

			


Payment of tuition or fees that is returned from the financial Institution unpaid will result in a dishonored fee of $25. After three returned payments, Franklin University will no longer accept an electronic or personal check for payment on the student account. All future payments must be made via credit card or money order.
Failure to clear a returned payment for tuition or fees will result in administrative withdrawal from registration after notification of the returned payment.






			
  Transcripts & Records Policy for Students with Unresolved Financial Obligations

			


In the event of any unresolved balance of any nature on the student’s account, the following records will not be released:

Diplomas
Transfer credit information
Transcripts

These records will not be released until the balance is paid in full or the past-due balance is resolved. When all financial obligations are resolved, the student is again eligible to receive transcripts and all university services.
