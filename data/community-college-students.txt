  Community College Students



Consortium agreements/Student Contracts are written agreements between two or more institutions that allow you to take coursework simultaneously at different institutions for the purpose of completing your college degree. 
Franklin University collaborates with over 135 community and technical colleges around the nation. Check with your advisor to see if the Community College Alliance (CCA) program is right for you, and if there is a community college near you that participates in the CCA program.

  Book Advancement 

			


A Book Advance is an advance payment of your financial aid funds for the purpose of purchasing required textbooks for classes at your community college (host school).
A process is run at the beginning of each term to identify students eligible for Book Advance funds. Eligible funds will be sent via a selected refund preference and an email will be sent as notification of the Book Advance eligibility. General requirements for Book Advance eligibility must be met 10 days prior to the start of the term at Franklin University for consideration:

Financial aid must be packaged and accepted
Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) must be up-to-date
Student Contract must be processed
Enrollment at your community college (host school) must be confirmed
There must be enough financial aid available to cover tuition and fees at both schools, with the Book Advance coming from funds that would otherwise be refunded later in the term

NOTE:  Book Advances are not provided by request. Book Advances will be provided based on eligibility determined by the CCA Financial Services Specialist prior to the start of the term.






			
  Helpful Information 

			



Disbursement of Financial Aid may vary from the posted disbursement schedule because of the additional processing required for CCA students.
Franklin University does not pay the community college tuition directly; that is the responsibility of the student.
It is possible that tuition may be due at your community college prior to a refund of excess aid becoming available at Franklin University; make sure to contact your community college to discuss payment options for consortium students.
Notify the CCA Financial Services Specialist of any change in enrollment at your host school, as it may affect your financial aid eligibility.
An official transcript is required at the end of each term classes at the host school are included for financial aid in order to update your Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)
Check with your host school to see if they have any requirements specific to the consortium agreement/ Community College Alliance program. 
You can attend a maximum of two host schools within the same financial aid year.
If you receive any scholarships at your community college, you need to make sure to complete the Declaration of Outside Assistance form for Franklin University. 
Read over the bullet points in Step 3 of the Student Contract carefully, as it answers many potential questions related to the Community College Alliance program.









  How It Works




You can take courses at your community college, the "host school", and have those courses count toward a first bachelor's degree at Franklin University, the "home school."
The home school is the school that grants the degree, as well as process, awards and distributes financial aid. The host school is responsible for certifying your enrollment status and providing information, such as costs for tuition and fees, grades and withdrawal information. 

Step 1: Complete the FAFSA
Franklin University is your  Home School (Code: 003046)
Step 2: Review the Consortium Agreement 
Fully understand your rights and responsibilities as a CCA student; then complete the Student Contract. We will send a copy of your Student Contract and the Community College Signature Form to the Financial Aid Office at your Host School (your community or technical college).
Step 3: Review Your Offer Letter
Have a plan for paying tuition at both schools. Please note that your tuition to your Host School may be due before a refund from Franklin is available. 
Step 4: Maintain Your Enrollment Status 
If your status changes during the term, please notify Franklin University's Student Financial Services.
Step 5: Send Transcripts 
Request an official transcript from the Host School to be sent to Franklin University at the end of the term.

		Is Financial Aid available?
		




Yes. Talk with one of our helpful Financial Aid staff members about Franklin's commitment to helping you fund your education.




		What is Franklin’s 3+1 Transfer Program?
		


Franklin offers a 3+1 transfer option for several programs from many of our community college partners, where students can finish their associate degree at their community college and complete additional courses at the community college while concurrently enrolled at Franklin.




		Who do I contact with questions about transferring to Franklin? 
		


Franklin has Community College Regional Managers (CCRM) who work specifically with students transferring from our partner community colleges. CCRMs can assist students early on while working toward an associate degree to determine which classes at the community college will transfer to Franklin, when to begin classes at Franklin, and how to continue taking bridge courses at the community college. CCRM’s can be contacted directly by emailing transferinfo@franklin.edu.
