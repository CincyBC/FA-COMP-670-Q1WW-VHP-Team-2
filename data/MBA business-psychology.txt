You’ll be introduced to the concepts of neuroscience and learn to apply a neuroscience tool to resolve workplace issues.Evaluate the match between intelligence types and organizationsYou’ll explore various intelligence types, as well as what constitutes intelligence.

You’ll study the relationship between creativity, innovation and change and design a process to stimulate organizational innovation.
