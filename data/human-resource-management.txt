  M.S. in Human Resource Management Program Overview





  Learn how to grow organizations and individuals to greatness

The top-down, hierarchical mindset of old industrial bureaucracies doesn’t provide the flexibility, creativity and empowerment that define today’s high-performing workforces. Franklin’s transfer friendly M.S. in Human Resource Management (MSHRM) program focuses on key issues such as the role of people in driving a global competitive business, developing the leadership skills and knowledge of all employees, appreciating the diverse nature of today’s workforce, and creating cultures that reward, recognize and appreciate all employees.Build your HR knowledge with hands on assignments  As a working professional, you’ll draw on your own experiences as well as those of your classmates. Most assignments in the master’s in HR program are applied so you’ll bring work challenges to your classwork and take solutions to your workplace. You’ll research and solve case examples related to the content of the course, or write about real-time issues happening in your work setting. Assignments will prompt you to examine leadership, team operations, restructuring, enhancing organizational culture, ensuring fair pay and benefits and other prevalent HR topics. Gain knowledge and skills aligned with industry best practices Franklin’s 14-month MSHRM program is recognized by the Society of Human Resource Management for offering a complete curriculum to provide students with the skills they need to excel in HR roles. Adding to the industry-aligned curriculum is the extensive real-world expertise of Franklin’s highly qualified instructors who will help you understand and appreciate the significant competitive, technical, legal and cultural issues of the workplace.  Learn to bring out the best in individuals at every level While organizations struggle with escalating demands for high-quality goods and services and increasing global competition, most organizations already have the resources they need to succeed. Where many organizations struggle is not in available resources and infrastructure; it is with the leadership, management and employees that comprise the organization. In the MSHRM program, you’ll understand the importance of providing great services to employees and creating an organizational culture that encourages dignity, respect, safety, a high level of skill and knowledge, and the ability to be flexible and build deep organizational trust. Get credit for what you know – before you even take your first classFranklin demonstrates its commitment to ambitious adults by honoring their previous professional experiences and credentials, which includes national certifications. If you have earned certifications through professional organizations including the Society of Human Resource Management (SHRM) and HRCI, you may be able to get course credit toward your master’s degree. The SHRM SCP (Senior Certified Professional) and the HRCI-SPHR (Senior Professional in HR) are both equivalent to HRM 701 (Human Resource Management), a 4-credit hour course. The HRCI-GPHR (Global Professional in HR) is equivalent to HRM 709 (International Human Resource Management), which is also 4 credit hours. To leverage your certification for course credit to satisfy degree requirements, you’ll need to submit your credential documentation. Your admissions advisor will be happy to assist you in any way.  Earn your Human Resources master's degree online from a university built for busy adultsEarn your Human Resources master's on your terms by taking classes 100% online.
