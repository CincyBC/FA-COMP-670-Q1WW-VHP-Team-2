  File Your FAFSA




Submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)If you’re interested in getting financial aid to help pay for college, you first must file a FAFSA. The FAFSA is used to determine your eligibility for aid, so you must file a new FAFSA every school year. Be sure to include Franklin’s school code, 003046, on your FAFSA. New students who plan to use financial aid to assist in financing their education are required to complete the FAFSA before registering for their first semester. FAFSAs are accepted on a rolling basis; however, we do encourage you to apply by the priority deadline to have the best opportunity for federal and state grants. Funding may be limited for those who complete the FAFSA after these priority deadlines. File the 2025-26 FAFSA by the Priority Processing DeadlinesTermPriority Date*Summer 2025March 15, 2025Fall 2025June 15, 2025Spring 2026October 1, 2025                                                                                                                                       *FAFSAs accepted on a rolling basis; these are priority dates Preparing to file your FAFSA?

  Other Tuition Assistance

			


You may be eligible for other types of college financial aid or tuition assistance, such as employer reimbursement, Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation (BVR), National Guard, prepaid tuition plans, or scholarships.
If you are receiving tuition assistance (payment or reimbursement -- not grants or loans) from another source outside of financial aid, please complete the Declaration of Outside Tuition Assistance form located on the Documents & Forms page. Failure to disclose this information before Franklin determines your financial aid eligibility may result in delays, or partial or full loss of financial aid funds.






			
  FAFSA Verification

			


You may randomly be selected by the Federal government to verify the accuracy of your FAFSA information. You may also be selected for verification if your FAFSA was incomplete, inconsistent, or based on estimated information.
If selected, Franklin’s Financial Aid Office will send you an email with detailed information about what to do next, including submitting tax documentation or other forms.








  Review Your SAR




Check the Accuracy of Your Student Aid Report (SAR)
Once you’ve filed your FAFSA, it takes about two weeks for the Department of Education's Central Processor to notify you by email that your Student Aid Report (SAR) is available on the FAFSA website. If, after two weeks, you do not receive your SAR notification, please call FAFSA customer service at 1-800-433-3243.
Once you’ve received notification, sign into the FAFSA website using your FSA ID (username and password). Review your SAR for accuracy. If you need to make changes or updates to any of the information you reported on your FAFSA, make the necessary corrections and submit them. 
Your SAR will not tell you how much financial aid, if any, you’ll get. Franklin, however, uses the information to calculate your aid and send you an Offer Letter.







  Sign & Submit Your Offer Letter




Your Offer Letter 
Once you’ve completed enrollment and all other documentation is received, Franklin’s Financial Aid office will determine your financial aid eligibility and calculate your award. The Financial Aid Office’s review process usually takes about 15 days. 
If you’ve applied for financial aid from Franklin, you’ll receive an official Offer Letter. Offer Letters are sent electronically through your Self-Service.
Your Offer Letter shows the type(s) and amount of college financial aid you are eligible for within a specific school term or academic year.
Accepting Your Offer
Please review your Offer Letter. Sign and click to send your acceptance. Your financial aid or student loan will not be processed until we receive your signed Offer Letter. Please contact Student Financial Services with any questions or concerns. 





			
  Important Notes

			



If your enrollment hours change, your eligibility for programs and/or aid amounts also may change.
In addition to the Offer Letter, if you’re currently enrolled or are a prospective military student, you’ll receive documentation related to your financial aid package called the College Financing Plan which is available to view on Self-Service. This document shows a comparison of costs and financial aid offers at multiple institutions. 
This standardized form is not currently mandated by the federal government, so not all schools will send it to you. Franklin University has voluntarily adopted the use of the College Financing Plan to help you in making the decision that best fits your needs.







			
  How to read the "Terms of Award" on Your Offer Letter

			


Your financial aid is based on information you provided on your FAFSA. It is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information on every FAFSA transaction.
Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Status:
This is the current status of your academic progress for financial aid.
Enrollment Hours:
Aid is based on the hours of enrollment listed.
Changes in your enrollment may impact your aid.
Code Definitions

A: Award is accepted via printed Offer Letter.
C: Award canceled.
E: Funds that are not transmitted by the Financial Aid office but are included in the estimated financial assistance.
G: Award is a tentative amount.  Amount of funds are pending State of Ohio or Federal government budget approval.
H: Hold until eligibility is determined.
N: Not eligible
P: All Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loan funds placed into this status until an Offer Letter has been received/processed.
R: Rejected by you.
S: Award Accepted Online
T: Indicates your last term of eligibility.
W: Withdrawn from Federal Title IV eligibility.
Z: Federal restrictions have been placed on your account but state funds are still applicable.

Important Comments
See your required documents section on Self-Service. Further action may be required.
Special Circumstances
If you have circumstances that were not reflected in the FAFSA process, you may have the right to appeal. Contact us at 1.877.341.6300 to review your situation and receive appeal information.
Revisions and Cancelations
The University reserves the right to review, revise, or cancel an award at any time.
Aid Notes

A Federal Work Study award is not a guarantee of employment or financial aid.
Federal student loans listed on the Offer Letter are gross amounts. The actual funds received may be less due to fees assessed by the lender.
State aid will only cover up to the cost of tuition and fees and is not refundable to the student.
Federal Financial Aid funds are permitted to be utilized for one repeat of a course that was already successfully completed, aid cannot be used to retake courses that have been successfully completed more than once. You are only eligible to receive financial aid funds for courses that apply toward your current degree program.

Student Responsibility
Franklin University is committed to assisting students in applying for financial aid resources. However, students enrolled in courses at Franklin are ultimately responsible for paying their tuition and fees.








  Additional Information




Because Franklin University wants to make sure you maximize all available financial aid resources while minimizing your debt obligations, we’ve compiled some other information you should know about federal financial aid and student loans.





			
  Basic Eligibility Requirements

			



In general, to be eligible for financial aid at Franklin University, you must:
Complete a FAFSA for the school year
	
Have a high school diploma, an associate or higher degree. Proof includes
High school transcript, GED, or equivalent; or,


Official college/university transcript showing associate or higher degree
Be enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a regular student working toward a degree or certificate in an eligible program.
Be enrolled at least half-time (for most programs).
Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen.
Have a valid Social Security Number (unless you're from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or the Republic of Palau).
Make satisfactory academic progress.
Demonstrate financial need (in most cases).
Be registered with the Selective Service if you are a male aged 18-25 year (for state aid only). Visit www.sss.gov for more information.
Sign the certification statement on the FAFSA stating that you are not in default on federal student loans or owe on a federal student grant, and you will use federal student aid for educational purposes only.







			
  Community College Alliance Students

			


Consortium agreements
Consortium agreements/Student Contracts are written agreements between two or more institutions that allow you to take coursework simultaneously at different institutions for the purpose of completing your college degree. Under this type of agreement, you can take courses at your community college, the "host school," and have those courses count toward a first bachelor’s degree at Franklin University, the "home school."
The home school is the school that grants the degree, as well as processes, awards and disburses financial aid. The host school is responsible for certifying your enrollment status and providing information, such as costs for tuition and fees, grades and withdrawal information.
The Consortium Agreement consists of two parts:

Blanket Consortium Agreement (school): The Blanket Consortium Agreement is an agreement between the host and home school. The host school completes the blanket agreement and submits it to Franklin University's Financial Aid Office.
Student Contract (student): If you plan to attend your community college for any term within the award year and would like Franklin to consider hours at your community college in your financial aid award, you must submit a Student Contract. If you anticipate only attending Franklin University, you are not required to submit this.

The Student Contract is available on our Documents and Forms page. 
Official Transcripts (student)
At the conclusion of each trimester of enrollment, you must request that official transcripts* be sent to Franklin University's Transfer Credit Office. Your official transcripts are used to determine completion of courses and satisfactory academic progress. Failure to submit official transcripts may cause a reduction or cancellation of financial aid for the term in which grades were not submitted, and will prohibit aid from being processed for subsequent terms.
*An official transcript is one that has been received directly from each college or university listed on your application. It must bear the college seal, date, and an appropriate signature. Transcripts received that do not meet these requirements are not be considered official and are routinely rejected for any permanent use.
The Financial Aid Process for Franklin's Community College Alliance Students
Step 1: Complete the FASFA 
Franklin University is your Home School (Code: 003046)
Step 2: Review the Consortium Agreement 
Fully understand your rights and responsibilities as a CCA student; then complete the contract. We will then send your Student Contract and the Community College Signature Form to the Financial Aid Office at your Host School (your community college or technical college).
Step 3: Review Your Offer Letter 
Have a plan for paying tuition at both schools. Please note that your tuition to your Host School may be due before a refund from Franklin is available.
Step 4: Maintain Your Enrollment Status 
If your status changes during the term, please notify Franklin University's Student Financial Services Office.
Step 5: Send Transcripts 
Request an official transcript from the Host School to be sent to Franklin University as the end of the term.






			
  Transfer Students

			


If you're transferring to Franklin University from another school in the middle of a financial aid year, and you received federal or state aid at your previous school, you must do the following:

Cancel aid at your previous school, including future scheduled loan disbursements.
Add Franklin University (school code: 003046) to your Student Aid Report (SAR). To add Franklin you must either:
	
Update your FAFSA; or
Call the Federal Processor at 1-800-433-3242.


Remove your previous school's code from your FAFSA.
