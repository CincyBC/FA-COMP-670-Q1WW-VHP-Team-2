  Veteran Service Recognition Award

			


Franklin University’s Office of Military and Veteran Affairs is excited to offer the Veteran Service Recognition Award! 
The award is granted annually to 10 students of our veteran population. As a need-based award, it is available to current degree-seeking undergraduate and graduate Franklin University students who were honorably discharged from the United States Armed Forces and do not receive full tuition funding through the VA. 
Undergraduate students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.50, while graduate students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 throughout the year. 
Eligible students can receive up to $1,000 per term ($3,000 per year) for each term of the academic year (Fall, Spring, and Summer). The award will not automatically renew after one academic year, but students are encouraged to reapply annually. The scholarship can be used for tuition and any associated e-textbook fees, but will not be awarded for more than the student’s account balance and will be disbursed after other military awards and benefits are applied.
Those who qualify will receive further information via their university email. For further details on the Veteran’s Service Recognition Award, including deadlines and other requirements, email OMVA@franklin.edu for additional questions.
