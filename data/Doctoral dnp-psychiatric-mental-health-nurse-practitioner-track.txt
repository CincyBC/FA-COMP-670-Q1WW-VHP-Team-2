  DNP-PMHNP Frequently Asked Questions






		What is a DNP degree? 
		


A DNP or Doctor of Nursing Practice degree is a clinical practice degree, and is different from the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Nursing degree, which is a research degree.




		What can you do with a DNP degree? 
		


Plenty! As a DNP graduate, you’ll be prepared to hold a variety of job positions and roles in leadership, administration, informatics and, if you’re prepared as a nurse practitioner, advanced practice.




		Why get a DNP degree?
		


If you want to become an advanced nursing leader, a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) is considered the terminal degree for clinical practice.




		What makes Franklin’s DNP degree unique? 
		


Franklin streamlines your educational experience. We’ll help you finish faster and let you practice what you learn while you learn – thanks to embedded practicum hours and a scholarly project that are included within our courses.




		How long is an online DNP program?
		


Congratulations on wanting to advance your education and career through Franklin’s Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree program! The Franklin online DNP is designed for busy nurses, so, depending on your previous education and area of focus, you may be able to complete your terminal degree in 6-11 trimesters (24-48 months).




		When can I start a DNP degree?
		


Getting started with your Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP degree) is easy and convenient at Franklin. We offer two start dates a year in fall and spring. Talk to your admissions advisor to find the start date that's right for you.




		How much will my DNP degree cost?
		


At Franklin, you’ll get a quality education at a competitive cost so you can afford to invest in your future right now. Our helpful staff can talk with you about flexible financing options as well as financial aid programs. See current tuition and rates here.




		Do I need to have an MSN before starting a DNP program?
		


Good news! The answer is “no.” You can be admitted to the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree program through Franklin’s BSN to DNP pathway. With this pathway, you will take two bridge courses (NURS 800 and NURS 805) first. Once you successfully complete these courses, you will be fully admitted to the DNP program. By the way, this is the same pathway that anyone with a BSN and a non-nursing master’s degree would follow for the DNP degree.




		For the BSN to DNP degree, will I also earn the MSN degree? 
		


No. However, as a prerequisite to full admission to the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program, you will complete two bridge courses that cover foundational knowledge from the M.S. in Nursing (MSN) program.   




		How will I complete the practicum hours for the DNP?  
		


Practicum hours focus on skill development in essential areas, including leadership, informatics, finance and patient safety. Some of your practicum hours will be completed at a practicum site with a preceptor to guide your work. Other hours are considered experiential and will be facilitated by a faculty member as part of your coursework. In addition, as part of your practicum, you will develop a scholarly project using an evidence-based intervention and quality improvement framework that addresses a gap in practice, process, or policy at your practice site. Bottom line? You’ll be able to complete about half of your practicum hours during your coursework!




		If I complete the PMHNP at the same time as the DNP, will I have to do clinical hours?
		


Yes. You will complete 600 clinical hours in the Psychiatric Mental Health Primary Care Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) specialty at a medical office or clinic.




		What is an DNP-Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner degree?
		


An DNP-Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner is a degree that provides a holistic approach to diagnose acute, episodic and chronic mental health illnesses and provide treatment options that include medication, psychotherapy or a combination of the two.




		What can you do with an DNP-Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner degree?
		


Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioners specialize in psychiatric mental healthcare across the lifespan; they may work in private practice settings, integrated primary care, and acute care settings.




		Why get an DNP-Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner degree?
		


In addition to nursing fundamentals, psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners have an essential understanding of cognitive processes, behaviors, and how life events affect the mental health of patients. Their education and practice focus on serving those patients. The PMHNP will often serve as the specialized provider for patients over the long term, typically taking a wellness-based and holistic approach to mental healthcare while also providing integrated care for mental illness in primary care settings.
